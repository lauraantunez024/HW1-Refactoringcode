# Homework 1 Refactoring Code

## Project Goals

The goal of this assignment was to make given html more semantic and clean up the corresponding CSS.



The given HTML had a lot of div elements and excessive use of id and classes. In certain sections, an id and class of the same name was applied to each of the sections.

The CSS was also full of duplicated styling and wasn't following best practices.
